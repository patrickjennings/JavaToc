About JavaToc

JavaToc is an interface written in java that can be used to connect to and send
and receive commands from the AOL TOC server. The interface uses the TOC2
(Talk to OSCAR 2) protocol developed by AOL. The TOC2 protocol is a wrapper for
AOL's proprietary OSCAR protocol used for its AIM clients. TOC2 is an ASCII-
based protocol which makes it much easier to work with compared with its binary
counterpart, OSCAR.
